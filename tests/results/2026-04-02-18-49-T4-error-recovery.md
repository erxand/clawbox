# T4 — Error recovery test
**Date:** 2026-04-02 18:49
**Fix time:** 27s

## What was tested
1. Created an npm project with Express
2. Added a `require('nonexistent-package')` to break it
3. Asked the agent to diagnose and fix

## Initial error
```
node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1386
  throw err;
  ^

Node.js v22.22.1
```

## Agent response (summary)
```
The issue is `require('nonexistent-package')` — a module that doesn't exist and isn't used anywhere. It's just a dead import.
Fixed. The problem was a `require('nonexistent-package')` — a module that doesn't exist in `node_modules` or `package.json` and wasn't actually used anywhere. Removed the dead import and the server starts fine, responding with "Hello" on `/`.
```

## Fixed index.js
```javascript
const express = require('express');

const app = express();
app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello'));
app.listen(3000);
```

## Verification
```
Hello
```
